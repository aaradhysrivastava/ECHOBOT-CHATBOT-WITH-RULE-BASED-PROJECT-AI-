🗣️ Unified Voice & Text ChatBot with GUI
This project is a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python that supports both text and voice interactions through a clean graphical user interface (GUI). It integrates speech recognition, wake-word detection, and text-to-speech to act as a lightweight virtual assistant.

📌 Features
💬 Chat via text or voice.
🎙️ Wake word detection: activates voice mode when hearing "voice".
🔈 Responds using text-to-speech.
🧠 Handles speech input using speech recognition.
🖼️ GUI built using Tkinter with scrollable conversation window.
👋 Say "bye" to exit the assistant.

⚙️ How It Works
Launches a Tkinter-based GUI for chat.
When the word "voice" is detected in input, it enters voice mode.
Listens to the user's voice and processes it using speech_recognition.
Responds based on simple rule-based logic.
Listens again or exits if the user says "bye".

🧪 Installation & Usage
🔧 Requirements
Install required dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

You can switch between text and voice input. Just type or say "voice" to activate voice mode.

🔁 Example Output

You: voice
(Chatbot switches to voice mode)
You (speaking): Hello

You (speaking): bye
Bot (speaks): Goodbye!
